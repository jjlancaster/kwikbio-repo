kwikbio-repo
============

First kwiKBio repository.
Welcome to the kwiKBio Community!!  This note: 3-1-2019.
We are currently setting up projects for the Community Forum feedback to flow through BIOMEDSERVER.COM.  We are open to suggestions and assistance in improving this function (as well as any other ideas, comments, etc., for other functionality).
Some aspects of the kwiKBio back-end are run through an Azure server instance (our experiment vendor and consultant services search, for example), whereas other web sites (biomedserver.com; bionook.com; loojl.com) are hosted at GoDaddy.  Some are slim sites, some allow additional pages of html structure to be created.  We will be using many combinations as we go along!

Please be patient as we begin our learning with GitHub processes and projects.  Upcoming projects will include:
-- accessing a triple-store semantic database with Graph-QL and/or SPARQL;  We will begin with bio2rdf.org as example site;
-- scraping the return from the semantic query using NLP to get preliminary list of entities and predicate relations;
-- setting up a first parsing of the entity list, conjoined with a set of kwiKBio search parameters (user-entered), as a search into a systems biology model repository (such as N-Dex, or biomodels, etc.);
-- setting up simple d3.js type graphics window to allow graph network illustrations to draw for user;
-- display a moderate sysBio pathway model or causal network model (limited to 27 entities initially, for development ease);
-- integrate the kwiKBio simulation tool (simple graphics with parameter setting; clock-solve cycles; scoping; nesting);
-- integrate our sim tool with R packages and other standard tools that can help make things seamless for users;
-- and 400 more steps as we move forward.

NOTE on Open Source vis-a-vis kwiKBio.inc proprietary and commercial development:
     kwiKBio is a for-profit corporation, headquartered in VT.  
     While many of the components we are building and using, and proposing to build and use, will be open source components, we will be assertive about our patented methods that will comprise a COMBINATION of a CERTAIN set of said tools, used in a certain way, as an online business method.  The COMBINATION that we are building is NOT OPEN SOURCE.  This means that you will not be allowed to practice the claimed invention except through kwiKBio, or through kwiKBio's licensees.
     In other words, as an analogy, we have patented a radio, or a car, for which we have not yet fabricated all the parts.  Much of these parts are like simple LEGO pieces, with many existing already; and others we must build from the functional specification.  We intend for these "LEGO pieces" to be open source, just like the transistors and dials in a radio, or like spark plugs and tires for a car.  The COMBINATION of those pieces into our Research Guidance Engine, however, is exclusive and proprietary technology owned by kwiKBio, Inc.
     The reason for this is so that we can move a moderate revene stream into accelerating development of the platform.  We are pledged to always having a FREE access to part of our offering and intend the paid subscription to be $8/month per user for advanced tools, and we will charge a small transaction fee for research out-sourced through our site to vendors (on the order of 6% per transaction; which we believe will be invisible to users if vendors pass on a fraction of their marketing save!).
     We have bootstrapped to get here, so that investors cannot sell us out to pharma.  It's important.  We hope you understand and support us in this approach.
